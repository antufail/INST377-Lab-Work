    <h3>Image Carousel</h3>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.jpg'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.gif'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.png'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.svg'/>
    <p>Each image have a unique aspect to it. JPG has a background in this case 
    but is typically good for photos. GIF is great for small animations and 
    the bouncing mochi is so cute. PNG is perfect for a still pic of the mochi 
    as it's good for icons. Lastly, SVG is good for scaling up as it uses vectors 
    (likely Linear Algebra background such as SVD which is not fun) to help.</p>
