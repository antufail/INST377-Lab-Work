Replace this with your complete HTML from Lab 1

Hook it up to CSS by including style.css in the <head> tag

Then add CSS class names to your HTML to make it look like the lab pictures.
For example: <div class="selector">

You should not need to edit the CSS to do this, only the HTML.

Don't forget to add an actual set of image descriptions to your image carousel.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Anna Tufail's Labs For INST377</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

  <div class = "wrapper">

  <body>
    <header class="header"><h1>Anna Tufail's Labs For INST377</h1></header>

    <h2>Albums</h2>

      <li>If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power (Deluxe) - Halsey</li>
      <li>Coke Studio (Season 14) - Various Artists</li>

    <h3>Image Carousel</h3>
    <div> <!--images box-->
    <img src = 'images/mochi.jpg'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.gif'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.png'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.svg'/>
    <p>Each image have a unique aspect to it. JPG has a background in this case 
    but is typically good for photos. GIF is great for small animations and 
    the bouncing mochi is so cute. PNG is perfect for a still pic of the mochi 
    as it's good for icons. Lastly, SVG is good for scaling up as it uses vectors 
    (likely Linear Algebra background such as SVD which is not fun) to help.</p>
